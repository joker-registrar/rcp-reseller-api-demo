Joker.com PHP client - Installation
-------------------------

    To successfully install this client application you
    need knowledge of Web servers, PHP and file systems.

    In principle the installation is only a copy and run.
    The first thing to do is ensure that your Web server runs PHP files
    and if not to configure it appropriately.

    Quick installation:
    1. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories):

    tar -xzvf package_name_x.x.x.tar.gz

    in your webserver's document root. If you don't have direct access to your
    document root, put the files in a directory on your local machine, and
    transfer the directory on your web server using, for example, ftp.

    2. Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is running
    in safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different from the owner of other
    scripts will be a problem). Be sure that the application can write log files, temp 
    files and sessions. This means that the folders specified in config.php should be 
    made writeable for the application.

    3. It is recommended that you protect the directory in which you installed the client
    (unless it's on a closed intranet), for example with HTTP-AUTH (in a .htaccess file).

    4. Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php in your browser.
    The Joker.com PHP client should now display a welcome screen with a login dialog.

    Have fun and don't forget to send feedback!
